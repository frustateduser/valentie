# 💝 Will You Be My Valentine?

A fun and interactive Valentine's Day web application where you can ask someone to be your Valentine with playful animated buttons and responses! And reject them each time with a new reason!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅

## Features

- **Interactive Valentine's Card**: Beautiful gradient background with floating heart animations
- **Smart NO Button**: The "NO" button cleverly evades your cursor, making it near-impossible to click!
- **Dynamic Responses**: 
  - Click "YES" → Confetti celebration animation by rejecting to go and mock others.
  - Click "NO" → Receives a creative rejection reason from [No-as-a-Service API](https://naas.isalman.dev)
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Gradient background shifts, floating hearts, confetti effects, and button transitions
- **Clean UI**: Modern styling with glassmorphism effects on the footer

## How It Works

1. **YES Button**: Click to celebrate with confetti animation and a rejection message.
2. **NO Button**: Attempts to click it, but the button moves away from your cursor! When you finally manage to click it, you'll receive a humorous reason why the answer could be "no"
3. **Dynamic Styling**: The result message appears centered on screen with a glowing effect
